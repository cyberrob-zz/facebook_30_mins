================

a Chrome extension for remind user how long he's been using Facebook in a day. 

This idea is from a movement from [NCCU student](http://mag.udn.com/mag/edu/storypage.jsp?f_ART_ID=512815) to persuade everyone to use Facebook less a day, to have more sense of the surrounding world & friends. I like it very  much. So I think why not write a extension for logging my Facebook usage? I know I'm kinda of addicted to Facebook. But I might still be surprised how much time I've been wasting on it.

It's my first Chrome extension. Kinda of try-out.

###Todo:
1. ~~Prepare a popup for showing how much time spent in Facebook~~
2. Options for configuring ~~usage limit~~, other site to monitor
3. ~~Save daily usage into local storage~~
4. ~~Upload to Chrome Web Store[Drafted]~~

###Update July 4, 2014:
1. It's a early stable version now.
2. It may apply to any other sites as well. But now it's just for Facebook.
3. Options for configuring usage limit
4. Fix the issue of timer still counting while Chrome is in the background.


###Installation:
You can install this Chrome extension [here from Chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook-usage-meter/ejfikepnokkjcjhjkpppdbpiccgjmjkc?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon) or just clone this repo to install it to Chrome in the developer mode.
