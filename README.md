================

a Chrome extension for remind user how long he's been using Facebook in a day. 

This idea is from a movement from [NCCU student](http://mag.udn.com/mag/edu/storypage.jsp?f_ART_ID=512815) to persuade everyone to use Facebook less a day, to have more sense of the surrounding world & friends. I like it very  much. So I think why not write a extension for logging my Facebook usage? I know I'm kinda of addicted to Facebook. But I might still be surprised how much time I've been wasting on it.

It's my first Chrome extension. Kinda of try-out.

###Todo:
1. ~~Prepare a popup for showing how much time spent in Facebook~~
2. Options for configuring ~~usage limit~~, other site to monitor
3. ~~Save daily usage into local storage~~
4. ~~Upload to Chrome Web Store[Drafted]~~

###Update July 2, 2014:
1. It's a early stable version now.
2. It may apply to any other sites as well. But now it's just for Facebook.
3. Options for configuring usage limit
